## Creating a pull request

When it's time to save your scripts, you will need to push your files to the pfb2018pfb2018_FinalProject repository. Follow these steps to push your files to the group repository.

1. Save your file.
2. In the terminal, navigate to the pfb2018pfb2018_FinalProject directory.
3. Type the following:

```
git add <filename>
git commit -m 'message'
git push
```

4. On your web browser, navigate to **your** fork of the pfb2018pfb2018_FinalProject repository.
5. Near the top left corner of the screen, click the button that say **New Pull Request**.
6. On the page that opens, you can now see your file. If it is the first time you are committing the file, it will appear here. If you are committing changes to the file, the changes you made will appear. Click the green button above your file that says **Create pull request**.
7. Step 6 will bring you to a page where you can add more details about your file. You will notice that the top field of the box is auto-populated with whatever you wrote in your `git commit -m 'message'`. If you want to add more specific description, you are welcome to. Otherwise, click the green button that says **Create pull request**.
8. The next screen will assess whether your changes can be merged and will notify you if they cannot. You are now finished creating a pull request! An email will be sent to the owner of the repository (in this case, Shasta) and the owner reviews changes before merging them.

Refer to Git Hub documentation for more details.
