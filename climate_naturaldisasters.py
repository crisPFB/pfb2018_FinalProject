# Functions that return penalties for environmental climate randomly.
#get_climate takes a randomly generated number and returns a penatly score for too hot or too cold climate_score
#get_naturaldisasters takes a randomly generated number and determines if a natural disaster happens (20% of the time)
#depending on the climate, which type of natural disaster happens, and assigns a penalty if a natural disaster occurs.
